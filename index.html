                Hiya, it's Tyler... for now at least. I'm a huuuge retro game fan, my personal favorites are arcade games, and NES games.
                That's mostly on knowledge though. My favorite games to play are strategy games and fps games.
                I'm also a bit of a math nerd. Though mostly I find higher dimensions of space particularly interesting.
                Another interest of mine is art, and drawing. Still a work in progress.
            </p>

                Out of this class (IGME 235) I hope to maybe not be proficient in html and the associated languages.
                However, I hope to be able to throw together a webpage or two for my personal projects.<br>
                My time on RIT has been great. The community is awesome. Being a game development and design major
                is great here. There are so many resources for me to use and make the most of. So once I graduate
                I'm looking to be working at a larger game company, and hopefully solo producing on the side.
